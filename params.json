{"name":"SoftDes Final Project","tagline":"Educational Game","body":"### Software Design Spring 2015\r\n**FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL**\r\n\r\n```\r\nMichael Costello\r\nSam Chin\r\nBrenna Manning\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Educational Application Development (PhET)\r\n\r\nBig Idea: A application that teaches some Aspect of Physics/Chemistry/Science like (PhET)\r\n    MVP: an interactive program that runs correct science and displays\r\n    Stretch Goal: maybe a web application as well to look at conversion? This really depends on which concept we decide to do, if we do something like circuit modeling, that could be pretty complicated because there are multiple parts, but this depends on the specific topic - there’s lots of scope!\r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan:\r\nDecide what physics concepts we want to model\r\nCode all the physics to demonstrate that the physics works\r\nFigure out different “cases” and how we want to demonstrate that. Make into different “levels” or challenges\r\n\r\n### Project Schedule:\r\n```\r\nWeek 1: Research/Planning - How do we make an app? Choose what we will model and get started on physics demonstration code\r\nWeek 2: Write code to demonstrate more physics cases\r\nWeek 3-4: Get our physics models into an app\r\nWeek 5: add more levels/challenges and additional features\r\nWeek 6: Buffer week for if anything goes wrong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Collaboration plan: \r\nWorking together in the same room but not necessarily pair programming. Working on different aspects of the code, but keeping each other up to date on what is going on, and asking questions when problems come up. Make major decisions as a group.\r\nLearning Goals: mobile app development, physics-modeling, user-oriented-design \r\nRisks: Pretty low risk - maybe not having enough for three people to do\r\nAdditional Course Content: mobile app development/intro to the languages? (If we decide to make a mobile application.) \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
