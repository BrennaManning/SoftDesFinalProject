{"name":"SoftDes Final Project","tagline":"Educational Game","body":"### Software Design Spring 2015\r\n**FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL**\r\n\r\n```\r\nMichael Costello\r\nSam Chin\r\nBrenna Manning\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Educational Application Development (PhET)\r\n\r\nBig Idea: A program that teaches some aspect of physics, chemistry, or other science, like (PhET).\r\n    MVP: An interactive program that runs correct science and displays.\r\n    Stretch Goal: To make our interactive program into a web application to learn about conversion. (This really depends on which concept we decide to do, if we do something like circuit modeling, that could be pretty complicated because there are multiple parts, but this depends on the specific topic - there’s lots of scope!) We would also like to add further features and levels to create a comprehensive tool.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan:\r\nDecide what physics concepts we want to model\r\nCode all the physics to demonstrate that the physics works\r\nFigure out different “cases” and how we want to demonstrate that. Make into different “levels” or challenges\r\n\r\n### Project Schedule:\r\n```\r\nWeek 1: Research/Planning - How will we make this program? Choose what we will model and get started on physics demonstration code.\r\nWeek 2: Write code to demonstrate more physics cases.\r\nWeek 3-4: Get our physics models into an interactive program.\r\nWeek 5: add more levels/challenges and additional features.\r\nWeek 6: Buffer week for if anything goes wrong.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Collaboration plan: \r\nWorking together in the same room but not necessarily pair programming. Working on different aspects of the code, but keeping each other up to date on what is going on, and asking questions when problems come up. Make major decisions as a group.\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:  web app development, physics-modeling, user-oriented-design\r\n\r\nRisks: Pretty low risk - maybe not having enough for three people to do\r\n\r\nAdditional Course Content: web/mobile development/intro to the languages?\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
