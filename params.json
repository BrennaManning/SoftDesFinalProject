{"name":"CircuitSim","tagline":"Software Design Final Project","body":"### **Software Design Spring 2015**\r\n\r\n###**CIRCUITSIM**\r\nCreated by Michael Costello & Brenna Manning\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Big Idea:\r\n**Why did we do this?**\r\n\r\nOur goal was to create a simulation game that could be both educational and interesting. This simulation game would help engineering students in entry level courses, such as ISIM at Olin College of Engineering, to learn about and get a chance to practice selecting components to use for building simple circuits. For example, a first year Olin student may need to know how to build a low pass filter of a certain cutoff frequency for an ISIM lab. Using our game, in level one, they could practice calculating what the cutoff frequency would be if they used resistors and capacitors of certain values, then, test if they did it right to pass the level. If they could solve that problem, they can use the same reasoning and calculations to build the circuit they need for their lab!  We also wanted our game to be user friendly, easy to understand, and visually appealing. We focused on filters and op amps.\r\n\r\nThe image below shows our GUI:\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Jq0Ny7q.png?1)\r\n\r\n###User Instructions\r\n**README**\r\n\r\nThe pygame library is required to run our game.\r\nTo run: python main.py\r\n\r\n###Implementation Information\r\n\r\nOur code for the game followed this structure for the fist level.\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/p4hLjw9.png?1)\r\n\r\nHowever, for subsequent levels, we decided to use separate model and controller files for each level. In retrospect, we realize that this was not the best way to structure our code. In the future we plan to consolidate into fewer files. \r\n\r\n###Results\r\nWe created a 3 level game.\r\nLevel 1: Build a low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 60 Hz from the given components.\r\nLevel 2: Build a high pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 60 Hz from the given components.\r\nLevel 3: Build a band pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 100kHz and 200kHz using an op amp and the given components. Calculate the output voltage.\r\n\r\nIf a player fails to complete the task of a level, the game asks them to try again. Once they build the correct filter, they can click to move on to the next level. Once a player completes level 3, they win the game!\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Cei1DMX.png?1)\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yNOdDFd.png?1)\r\n\r\n\r\n###Project Evolution\r\n***Narrative***\r\n\r\nFor our project, we wanted to create some sort of educational simulation game. We chose to make our game about simple circuits with a focus on filters and op amps. Initially our plan had been to make a breadboard simulation program, in which the user could place wires and components wherever they wanted to on our breadboard, and the program would figure out what kind of circuit it was and calculate cut-off frequencies and output voltages. We later realized that creating this was outside of the reasonable scope of our project. We chose instead to make a multi-level game in which the user could place components in open spaces available on the board for each level. This ended up being our final product. \r\n\r\n\r\n###Attribution\r\n**Resources Used:**\r\nwww.pygame.org\r\n\r\nwww.electronics-tutorials.ws\r\n\r\n***\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Code Review Reflection\r\n**Feedback and decisions**\r\n\r\nOur biggest question going into our code review was whether we should have our calculations done component by component with a common function for each circuit configuration, or if we should approach solving these calculations by hard-coding distinct equations to best suit each level. Overwhelmingly the response we received was that we would be better off hard coding for specific levels. \r\n\r\nThe feedback we got from the code review was definitely useful for our project, and we are now moving forwards in that direction and making solid progress.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we might want to have more big questions to ask at a review like this. This time we were primarily focused on the one question, which limited the feedback that we would get from the review. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Code Review Framing Document\r\n\r\nOur Code Review Framing Document can be found at:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBA2wbp4oPcw-T8TtQDaDp49x7jf9vB1HdUsGG3f8cw/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThe powerpoint presentation we used during the code review can be found at:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MA1UxnJFPN9MXqedZUm1tr5CWrb8rokEE-LiS0PJ5k8/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Design Review 1 Reflection\r\n\r\n**Feedback and decisions**\r\n\r\nOverall, we received positive feedback on our project, and people liked our\r\nconcepts. We gained some helpful input on each of our key questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is the appropriate scope for this project? How in-depth should we go?\r\n\r\nOur reviewers liked our focus on a specific user group (iSIM students, in\r\nthis case) though some said we should keep other intro-EE courses in mind.\r\nReviewers also acknowledged time constraints and agreed that we should begin\r\nwith some simple MVPs. We will continue to work on the small-scale, developing\r\na simple UI and a simple algorithm for circuit math.\r\n \r\nWhich specific aspects of circuits should our simulation cover?\r\n\r\nOur reviewers agreed that finding basic circuit values is a good place to start,\r\nbut thought it might be more helpful to do the reverse, calculating resistor/capacitor\r\nvalues for specified voltages and currents. Both basic and complex filters were deemed\r\nnecessary, but other circuit components like op-amps were suggested as well.\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat information would you like the simulator to tell you? (current? voltage?)\r\n\r\nSome reviewers suggested that a bode plot (a comparison of voltage oscillation frequency\r\nand strength of output) might be more helpful than simply showing predicted voltage values.\r\n \r\nReview process reflection\r\n\r\nWe think the review went well. We got feedback on some of the things we had been unsure\r\nabout and we think we provided a good amount of context for the audience. We did stick to\r\nour planned agenda, but for next time we might consider having a more specific/concrete plan,\r\nespecially in terms of how to use the space and available resources to our greatest advantage\r\nduring the review. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Design Review Framing Document\r\n\r\nOur Design Review Framing Document can be found at:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lj294VCaWQxfxUrCsu0QjCNLb6BnEO-KRSAd-D5TE4w/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##**PROJECT PROPOSAL**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Educational Application: CIRCUITSIM\r\n\r\nBig Idea: A program that teaches some aspect of physics, chemistry, or other science, like (PhET).\r\n    MVP: An interactive program that runs and displays a simulations of basic circuits. User can choose which components to input to try to complete tasks, and the program outputs the result. (What that is may depend on the objective of the level)\r\n    Stretch Goal: Additional levels, ability to use circuits you have built as blocks to be inputed to larger circuits later. An interactive breadboard. \r\n \r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan:\r\n\r\n### Project Schedule:\r\n```\r\nWeek 1: Research/Planning - How will we make this program? Choose what we will model and get started on physics demonstration code.\r\nWeek 2: Write code to demonstrate more physics cases.\r\nWeek 3-4: Get our physics models into an interactive program.\r\nWeek 5: add more levels/challenges and additional features.\r\nWeek 6: Buffer week for if anything goes wrong.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Collaboration plan: \r\nWorking together in the same room but not necessarily pair programming. Working on different aspects of the code, but keeping each other up to date on what is going on, and asking questions when problems come up. Make major decisions as a group.\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:  pygame, physics-modeling, user-oriented-design\r\n\r\nRisk: Underestimating scope of project.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
