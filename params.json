We gained some helpful input on each of our key questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is the appropriate scope for this project? How in-depth should we go?\r\n\r\nOur reviewers liked our focus on a specific user group (iSIM students, in\r\nthis case) though some said we should keep other intro-EE courses in mind.\r\nReviewers also acknowledged time constraints and agreed that we should begin\r\nwith some simple MVPs. We will continue to work on the small-scale, developing\r\na simple UI and a simple algorithm for circuit math.\r\n \r\nWhich specific aspects of circuits should our simulation cover?\r\n\r\nOur reviewers agreed that finding basic circuit values is a good place to start,\r\nbut thought it might be more helpful to do the reverse, calculating resistor/capacitor\r\nvalues for specified voltages and currents. Both basic and complex filters were deemed\r\nnecessary, but other circuit components like op-amps were suggested as well.\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat information would you like the simulator to tell you? (current? voltage?)\r\n\r\nSome reviewers suggested that a bode plot (a comparison of voltage oscillation frequency\r\nand strength of output) might be more helpful than simply showing predicted voltage values.\r\n \r\nReview process reflection\r\n\r\nWe think the review went well. We got feedback on some of the things we had been unsure\r\nabout and we think we provided a good amount of context for the audience. We did stick to\r\nour planned agenda, but for next time we might consider having a more specific/concrete plan,\r\nespecially in terms of how to use the space and available resources to our greatest advantage\r\nduring the review. \r\n\r\n`\r\n***\r\n`\r\n##**FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Educational Application \r\n\r\nBig Idea: A program that teaches some aspect of physics, chemistry, or other science, like (PhET).\r\n    MVP: An interactive program that runs correct science and displays.\r\n    Stretch Goal: To make our interactive program into a web application to learn about conversion. (This really depends on which concept we decide to do, if we do something like circuit modeling, that could be pretty complicated because there are multiple parts, but this depends on the specific topic - there’s lots of scope!) We would also like to add further features and levels to create a comprehensive tool.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan:\r\nDecide what physics concepts we want to model\r\nCode all the physics to demonstrate that the physics works\r\nFigure out different “cases” and how we want to demonstrate that. Make into different “levels” or challenges\r\n\r\n### Project Schedule:\r\n```\r\nWeek 1: Research/Planning - How will we make this program? Choose what we will model and get started on physics demonstration code.\r\nWeek 2: Write code to demonstrate more physics cases.\r\nWeek 3-4: Get our physics models into an interactive program.\r\nWeek 5: add more levels/challenges and additional features.\r\nWeek 6: Buffer week for if anything goes wrong.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Collaboration plan: \r\nWorking together in the same room but not necessarily pair programming. Working on different aspects of the code, but keeping each other up to date on what is going on, and asking questions when problems come up. Make major decisions as a group.\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:  web app development, physics-modeling, user-oriented-design\r\n\r\nRisks: Pretty low risk - maybe not having enough for three people to do\r\n\r\nAdditional Course Content: web/mobile development/intro to the languages?\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
