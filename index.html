<p><strong>Feedback and decisions</strong></p>

<p>Overall, we received positive feedback on our project, and people liked our
concepts. We gained some helpful input on each of our key questions:</p>

<p>What is the appropriate scope for this project? How in-depth should we go?</p>

<p>Our reviewers liked our focus on a specific user group (iSIM students, in
this case) though some said we should keep other intro-EE courses in mind.
Reviewers also acknowledged time constraints and agreed that we should begin
with some simple MVPs. We will continue to work on the small-scale, developing
a simple UI and a simple algorithm for circuit math.</p>

<p>Which specific aspects of circuits should our simulation cover?</p>

<p>Our reviewers agreed that finding basic circuit values is a good place to start,
but thought it might be more helpful to do the reverse, calculating resistor/capacitor
values for specified voltages and currents. Both basic and complex filters were deemed
necessary, but other circuit components like op-amps were suggested as well.</p>

<p>What information would you like the simulator to tell you? (current? voltage?)</p>

<p>Some reviewers suggested that a bode plot (a comparison of voltage oscillation frequency
and strength of output) might be more helpful than simply showing predicted voltage values.</p>

<p>Review process reflection</p>

<p>We think the review went well. We got feedback on some of the things we had been unsure
about and we think we provided a good amount of context for the audience. We did stick to
our planned agenda, but for next time we might consider having a more specific/concrete plan,
especially in terms of how to use the space and available resources to our greatest advantage
during the review. </p>

</h2>

<h3>
<a id="educational-application-circuitsim" class="anchor" href="#educational-application-circuitsim" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Educational Application: CIRCUITSIM</h3>

<p>Big Idea: A program that teaches some aspect of physics, chemistry, or other science, like (PhET).
    MVP: An interactive program that runs and displays a simulations of basic circuits. User can choose which components to input to try to complete tasks, and the program outputs the result. (What that is may depend on the objective of the level)
    Stretch Goal: Additional levels, ability to use circuits you have built as blocks to be inputed to larger circuits later. An interactive breadboard. </p>

<h3>
<a id="project-schedule" class="anchor" href="#project-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Schedule:</h3>

<pre><code>Week 1: Research/Planning - How will we make this program? Choose what we will model and get started on physics demonstration code.
Week 2: Write code to demonstrate more physics cases.
Week 3-4: Get our physics models into an interactive program.
Week 5: add more levels/challenges and additional features.
Week 6: Buffer week for if anything goes wrong.

</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="collaboration-plan" class="anchor" href="#collaboration-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collaboration plan:</h3>

<p>Working together in the same room but not necessarily pair programming. Working on different aspects of the code, but keeping each other up to date on what is going on, and asking questions when problems come up. Make major decisions as a group.</p>

<p>Learning Goals:  pygame, physics-modeling, user-oriented-design</p>

<p>Risk: Underestimating scope of project.</p>
