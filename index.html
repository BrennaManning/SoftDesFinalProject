<a id="big-idea" class="anchor" href="#big-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Big Idea:</h3>

<p><strong>Why did we do this?</strong></p>

<p>Our goal was to create a simulation game that could be both educational and interesting. This simulation game would help engineering students in entry level courses, such as ISIM at Olin College of Engineering, to learn about and get a chance to practice selecting components to use for building simple circuits. For example, a first year Olin student may need to know how to build a low pass filter of a certain cutoff frequency for an ISIM lab. Using our game, in level one, they could practice calculating what the cutoff frequency would be if they used resistors and capacitors of certain values, then, test if they did it right to pass the level. If they could solve that problem, they can use the same reasoning and calculations to build the circuit they need for their lab!  We also wanted our game to be user friendly, easy to understand, and visually appealing. We focused on filters and op amps.</p>

<p>The image below shows our GUI:

<a id="user-instructions" class="anchor" href="#user-instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User Instructions</h3>

<p><strong>README</strong></p>

<p>The pygame library is required to run our game.
To run: python main.py</p>

<a id="implementation-information" class="anchor" href="#implementation-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation Information</h3>

<p>Our code for the game followed this structure for the fist level.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/p4hLjw9.png?1" alt=""></p>

<p>However, for subsequent levels, we decided to use separate model and controller files for each level. In retrospect, we realize that this was not the best way to structure our code. In the future we plan to consolidate into fewer files. </p>

<h3>
<a id="results" class="anchor" href="#results" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results</h3>

<p>We created a 3 level game.
Level 1: Build a low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 60 Hz from the given components.
Level 2: Build a high pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 60 Hz from the given components.
Level 3: Build a band pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 100kHz and 200kHz using an op amp and the given components. Calculate the output voltage.</p>

<p>If a player fails to complete the task of a level, the game asks them to try again. Once they build the correct filter, they can click to move on to the next level. Once a player completes level 3, they win the game!</p>

<a id="code-review-reflection" class="anchor" href="#code-review-reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Review Reflection</h3>

<p><strong>Feedback and decisions</strong></p>

<p>Our biggest question going into our code review was whether we should have our calculations done component by component with a common function for each circuit configuration, or if we should approach solving these calculations by hard-coding distinct equations to best suit each level. Overwhelmingly the response we recieved was that we would be better off hard coding for specific levels. </p>

<p>The feedback we got from the code review was definitely useful for our project, and we are now moving forwards in that direction and making solid progress.</p>

<p>In the future, we might want to have more big questions to ask at a review like this. This time we were primarily focused on the one question, which limited the feeedback that we would get from the review. </p>

<p><strong>Feedback and decisions</strong></p>

<p>Overall, we received positive feedback on our project, and people liked our
concepts. We gained some helpful input on each of our key questions:</p>

<p>What is the appropriate scope for this project? How in-depth should we go?</p>

<p>Our reviewers liked our focus on a specific user group (iSIM students, in
this case) though some said we should keep other intro-EE courses in mind.
Reviewers also acknowledged time constraints and agreed that we should begin
with some simple MVPs. We will continue to work on the small-scale, developing
a simple UI and a simple algorithm for circuit math.</p>

<p>Which specific aspects of circuits should our simulation cover?</p>

<p>Our reviewers agreed that finding basic circuit values is a good place to start,
but thought it might be more helpful to do the reverse, calculating resistor/capacitor
values for specified voltages and currents. Both basic and complex filters were deemed
necessary, but other circuit components like op-amps were suggested as well.</p>

<p>What information would you like the simulator to tell you? (current? voltage?)</p>

<p>Some reviewers suggested that a bode plot (a comparison of voltage oscillation frequency
and strength of output) might be more helpful than simply showing predicted voltage values.</p>

<p>Review process reflection</p>

<p>We think the review went well. We got feedback on some of the things we had been unsure
about and we think we provided a good amount of context for the audience. We did stick to
our planned agenda, but for next time we might consider having a more specific/concrete plan,
especially in terms of how to use the space and available resources to our greatest advantage
during the review. </p>

<h3>
<a id="educational-application-circuitsim" class="anchor" href="#educational-application-circuitsim" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Educational Application: CIRCUITSIM</h3>

<p>Big Idea: A program that teaches some aspect of physics, chemistry, or other science, like (PhET).
    MVP: An interactive program that runs and displays a simulations of basic circuits. User can choose which components to input to try to complete tasks, and the program outputs the result. (What that is may depend on the objective of the level)
    Stretch Goal: Additional levels, ability to use circuits you have built as blocks to be inputed to larger circuits later. An interactive breadboard. </p>

<h3>
<a id="project-schedule" class="anchor" href="#project-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Schedule:</h3>

<pre><code>Week 1: Research/Planning - How will we make this program? Choose what we will model and get started on physics demonstration code.
Week 2: Write code to demonstrate more physics cases.
Week 3-4: Get our physics models into an interactive program.
Week 5: add more levels/challenges and additional features.
Week 6: Buffer week for if anything goes wrong.

</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="collaboration-plan" class="anchor" href="#collaboration-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collaboration plan:</h3>

<p>Working together in the same room but not necessarily pair programming. Working on different aspects of the code, but keeping each other up to date on what is going on, and asking questions when problems come up. Make major decisions as a group.</p>

<p>Learning Goals:  pygame, physics-modeling, user-oriented-design</p>

<p>Risk: Underestimating scope of project.</p>
